- 👋 Hi! My name is John Smith (@smathon36) and I'm passionate about full stack web development using React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

- 👀 I'm interested in exploring new technologies and improving my skills with data visualization tools such as D3.js and Tableau.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to optimize serverless architectures by implementing AWS Lambda functions and integrating them with Amazon API Gateway.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to education or health care that involve developing interactive dashboards and data analytics pipelines.

- 📫 You can reach me at smathon36@gmail.com or through LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-smith-031b83296/).
